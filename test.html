    <p><b><em>Kerala</em>(കേരളം)</b> is a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India.

      Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile states of Travancore-Cochin and Madras. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005
      sq mi), Kerala is the twenty-first largest Indian state by area.
      It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea
      to the west.
      With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population.
      It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram.

  <span class="sptext" > A legend of Onam is about the sweet memories of distant past when Mahabali, a celebrated emperor of the Asuras (demons) was supposed have ruled over Kerala. 
His period is believed as the golden age in the history of the country.
 A popular folk song narrates the glories of that period. When Mahabali (maveli) ruled, all men were equal, they were leading a life of happiness and nobody had any calamity-thus goes the song. 
 There was neither dishonesty nor deception, nor was there any instance of false utterance, use of counterfeit measures or other kinds of unfair practice.
  Perfect harmony, communal and otherwise, prevailed. In short, it was an ideal welfare State, the legend tells us.
   But the Devas got annoyed with the rule of Mahabali as their popularity were deteriorating alarmingly. They complained to Lord Vishnu and he reincarnated as Vamana - the dwarf. He approached Mahabali and begged for three feet of land. 
   Mahabali immediately granted Vamana's wish. Suddenly, the dwarf-sized Vamana grew into the skies and with one step covered the earth and with another the heavens. With no place to place the third step, Mahabali offered his head. 
   Vamana placed his foot on Mahabali's head and pushed him into pathalam (pathalam). But before sending Mahabali to the netherworld, Lord Vishnu gave Mahabali the boon that he can visit his subjects once in a year. 
   The day Mahabali visits his subjects is celebrated as Onam. 
   The time for his annual visit is in the first Malayalam month of chingam (August-September) and this occasion became one of jubilation throughout the land, reminiscent of the prosperous times of Mahabali.

 <span class="sptext">Among the various Hindu festivals in Kerala, Vishu occupies a unique position in more than one respect. 
  As symbol of the unostentatious Keralite, Vishu is free from the usual pomp and show and merry-making associated with other festivities. 
  The first day of the Malayalam month of medam is the unchangeable day of Vishu, whereas other festivals are determined according to the lunar asterisms on which they fall.
  This day on which Vishu falls is the astronomical New Year day and it is celebrated as such.
    The Malayalis believe that the fortunes for the year depend upon the nature of the object one sees first in the morning of Vishu day. 
    In order to fulfill the desire to look at the auspicious articles, they prepare a 'Kani' (an omen) on the previous day for seeing in the next morning.
    The next item is giving of handsel (kai neetam). The eldest member of the family takes some silver coins and gives them to a junior member with some raw rice and konna poovu (goldenshower flower).
      This is repeated in the case of other members also and they in turn give handsel to their juniors, relatives, servants etc.
      After this the children begin to fire crackers.
